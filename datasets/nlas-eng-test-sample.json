            "Premise 1": "Human beings have an innate desire for immortality, as evidenced by the existence of afterlife beliefs, religious doctrines, and scientific research on longevity.",
            "Premise 2": "The concept of immortality is a satisfactory explanation of this desire, as it offers a compelling solution to the problem of death and provides hope for a meaningful and fulfilling existence beyond the limits of our physical bodies.",
            "Premise 3": "No alternative explanation has been given so far that is as satisfactory as the concept of immortality, as other proposed solutions such as reincarnation or the idea of leaving a legacy still fail to address the fundamental fear of death and its irreversible finality.",
            "Conclusion": "Therefore, the concept of immortality is plausible as a hypothesis that accounts for the human longing for eternal life and serves as a compelling basis for further exploration and discussion."

As no alternative explanation has been put forward that proves the safety and ethics of cloning, the potential harms of cloning have to be taken seriously and considered in decision-making processes related to the development of this technology.",
